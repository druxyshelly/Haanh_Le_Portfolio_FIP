# Haanh_Le_Portfolio_FIP
The goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing web portfolio that successfully highlights my abilities, projects, and experiences. This website will work as my online portfolio, a place where I can showcase my skills, and a way to find new job prospects in the industry I've chosen.

## Installation
A personal portfolio website's installation process starts with acquiring a domain name and setting up hosting, which is followed by the creation of the website's code and content. After performing a local test, you set up the DNS settings for your domain and upload the website to the hosting server. Security precautions and database setup are examples of optional steps. Once the website is up and running, regular upkeep is essential to keep it secure and to maintain track of its performance.

## Usage
Owners of websites should maintain website security, track the contact form, and update their portfolios frequently. Visitors can look through the portfolio, get in touch with the owner through the online form, and interact with any blog posts that are accessible. The website should provide a smooth experience for both users.
